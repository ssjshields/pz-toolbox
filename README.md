# Features
• Fix mod mismatches quickly - (Failed to join server error)

• Automatic SP/ MP save backups - (SP backups are accessible from the main menu)

• QOL additions to the dedicated server files - (Modified StartServer64.bat)

# Resolve client-side mod mismatches
Instead of fumbling around your filesystem in frustration when you see this: 

![mod-mismatch-example](https://i.ibb.co/4MrjnP1/mismatchexample-S.png)

You can now run a simple script that will automatically detect the failing mod's ID from your logs, remove the mod in question, and open the Workshop page for the mod prompting you to re-subscribe.


# Expanded Server Hosting
• Backup saves on server boot & shutdown

• Force Steam_appID on launch - (If the server is ran from the Steam library, the incorrect app ID is inserted)

• CMD window now has a title: "Project Zomboid Dedicated Server" - (Previously "CMD.exe")
