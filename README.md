# Project Zomboid Toolbox
A collection of lightweight tools which can be utilized to make playing & managing Project Zomboid easier.

Designed for Windows and Project Zomboid dedicated servers, but these functions could be migrated to other platforms.

THIS REPO IS A WIP - CONTENT SUBJECT TO CHANGE

THESE TOOLS ARE WIP - THEY MAY NOT FUNCTION AS EXPECTED (e.g., logs doubling up)
