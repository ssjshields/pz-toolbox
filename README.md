# Project Zomboid Toolbox
A collection of lightweight tools which can be utilized to make playing & managing Project Zomboid easier.

Designed for Windows, but these functions could be migrated to other platforms.


# Features
• Fix mod mismatches quickly - (Failed to join server error)

• Automatic SP/ MP save backups - (SP backups are accessible from the main menu)

• QOL additions to the dedicated server files - (Modified StartServer64.bat)

# Expanded Server Hosting
• Backup saves on server boot & shutdown

• Force Steam_appID on launch - (If the server is ran from the Steam library, the incorrect app ID is inserted which bricks the server if mods are enabled)

• CMD window now has a title: "Project Zomboid Dedicated Server" - (Previously "CMD.exe")
